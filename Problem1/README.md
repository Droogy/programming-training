# Problem 1
Scenario
---
> I forgot a WinRAR-archive password.  
> I remember there was a name of someone from my (hypothetical) family: jake, melissa, oliver, emily.  
> I remember there was a year of birth of someone from my family: 1987, 1954, 1963.  
> I remember there was a symbol (that are so recommended by everyone):  
> ["!","@","#","$","%","&","*","-","=","_","+",".",","]  
> But I do not remember an order of these elements.  
> You have to find a list of all possible passwords, based on this information.  
> There are ~936 of them.
